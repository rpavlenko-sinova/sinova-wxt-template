# Functions Directory

Folder for holding constants

## Structure

- **`./`** - Root file. Put constants files here. Split them by context

## Best practices

1. **Declarative naming** - Name of file/constant should tell about in content.
2. **Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constant naming** - in this way they are easily distinguishable among other code.
